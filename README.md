# Closest-pair-easy-

Steps to Solve the Problem
Parse the Input:

Read the total number of points.
Read each coordinate and store them in a list or array.
Calculate Distances:

Use a nested loop to calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of points. The Euclidean distance between two points 

Find the Minimum Distance:

Keep track of the minimum distance encountered while calculating the distances.
Output the Result:

Print the minimum distance formatted to six decimal places.
Summary
In summary, you need to implement an algorithm to read a set of points, calculate the distances between each pair of points, find the smallest distance, and print that distance formatted to six decimal places.
